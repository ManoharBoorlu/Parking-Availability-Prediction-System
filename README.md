Parking Availability Prediction 
(Python, Machine Learning, Time Series Forecasting) – Master’s Thesis

•	Performed cleaning & exploratory data analysis on 200,000 rows of historical parking raw data from sensors.

•	Fitted various machine learning models like Autoregression, ARIMA and Neural Networks with Time Series Forecasting models to best predict the availability of parking at a given time.
